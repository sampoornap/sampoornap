## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

i am a fourth-year compsci and engineering undergrad from kolkata, wb and bentonville, arkansas. I am very interested in AI and how it can be used to build inclusive and responsible tech.
currently working on some cool research projects + applying to grad school!

right now - 

1. socrAItes : a socrated based coding tutor using llms
2. my undergrad thesis

   
exciting stuff -

1. diagnobot : a medical conversation and diagnostic chatbot
2. shakespeareGPT : gpt from scratch
3. x-assistant : a voice based assistant using llms
4. naivecontextcue : lower baseline for a language learning app


course projects - 

1. an end-to-end compiler written from scratch using C  ([compiler-design](https://github.com/sampoornap/compiler-design))
2. interpreter of a made-up-programming-language using racket   ([mupl](https://github.com/sampoornap/mupl))
3. a todo command using bash   ([todo](https://github.com/sampoornap/todo))
4. simulation of a computer with instructions and memory using verilog   
5. implementing a neural network from scratch   ([nnfs](https://github.com/sampoornap/nnfs))
6. a cool music playlist recommendation system   ([muzique](https://github.com/sampoornap/muzique))
